BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.\n\nOur technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\n\nOur Segments\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight.

Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\n\nMobility\n\nMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13252, "end_char_idx": 15813, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3546db6f-e568-47ae-b35e-10fbaf751197": {"__data__": {"id_": "3546db6f-e568-47ae-b35e-10fbaf751197", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e8b17de4b638b7cabd82c4694cc6c15f139c6b7c64b9fffc4e2cd3928f3dc77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9de94c0b-0c62-46a7-a5b1-ae2402457dfb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "89994b309150bbe8c441d23962bc58349c0dabd73039911e3354079a5e6881cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "beeb5a8c-d747-43d7-9f24-aa23562162c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1fcb948d01ea4c49d7e84e333fd0f3d476a10e47e694c6d6d1407496b91195f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate.

We launched our Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly\u2019s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. The acquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16648, "end_char_idx": 19166, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f2c58f0-35f7-47ef-a219-d891ffe1addd": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f2c58f0-35f7-47ef-a219-d891ffe1addd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e8b17de4b638b7cabd82c4694cc6c15f139c6b7c64b9fffc4e2cd3928f3dc77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "beeb5a8c-d747-43d7-9f24-aa23562162c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "73d836c22c73431018b81472dacfcb380c39ffc74acb8cebd404323c96ae30d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "44b2f4f8-f0c7-4334-aca4-9dac5b73cbb9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d8c2ed7e471e4f779da793d6bc83b6b123b9bb3632c9f289f0db32d62cbbf13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments.

Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people. Leading Technology We have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.

We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize\n\nthese industries.

Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n\nDelivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n\nFreight.

Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, and foreign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020 (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.\n\nPayments and Financial Services\n\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d).

Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created\n\nthrough its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment.

Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created\n\nthrough its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\n\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other app based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\n\nIn the United States, European Union, and Canada, we put forward proposals to improve the quality of independent work, calling on policymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having access to protections and benefits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 46001, "end_char_idx": 48607, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e1d5465-8e47-4af4-b917-de8197ce0f06": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e1d5465-8e47-4af4-b917-de8197ce0f06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e8b17de4b638b7cabd82c4694cc6c15f139c6b7c64b9fffc4e2cd3928f3dc77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba8f2439-49db-4edf-b430-55fe3dbadcbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "73f3b9c85a5b99ef88373a1660dbb9a8815acba169f1a882e8b154c5f1e84d3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f683177-8be5-480b-81c6-a82ed71b9e0a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ecc897e5b74d25ad6f84e512cab7b035e751a486ea5fb3c03366d0c1461433f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.

Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors.

Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could harm our business and operating results.

We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction.

Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent\n\n49\n\ncontractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our app was switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery.

We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\n\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers.

If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost.

In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.

These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\n\n71\n\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 392119, "end_char_idx": 394655, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6742b901-1b25-4797-b4cb-1dd39b164a3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6742b901-1b25-4797-b4cb-1dd39b164a3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e8b17de4b638b7cabd82c4694cc6c15f139c6b7c64b9fffc4e2cd3928f3dc77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "61b82437-a4ce-4ede-985d-cd5c89a07411", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "c5c6deb79214e43aeb61624ee6c3d0e1cbcd76564fb0d32161e1787d570c908d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "51f4a498-9741-4e2d-bc33-7bb7a42fb3d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0703701dc4a5f1c879774d134fddf6e36fd4240a102c0bfe56597eb2bed4614", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\n\n71\n\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.

Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\n\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d).

Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment assessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 418696, "end_char_idx": 421583, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "041192fd-0e56-4320-b5d4-1c95efce8199": {"__data__": {"id_": "041192fd-0e56-4320-b5d4-1c95efce8199", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e8b17de4b638b7cabd82c4694cc6c15f139c6b7c64b9fffc4e2cd3928f3dc77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6691a81-7297-410a-b62c-d519b880c79d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "25b1e1d7deac6ca5a4fdc7c6f7cea0390994f00e1209034eb46bf32ed0b61514", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a6b6841-0528-4e72-af89-3e9fc2e1fbae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4a551ab3c48d4cdfeb4286c64381700e090dccb23762961b29ec4d31b58d702", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality.

COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic conditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel restrictions, and \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings.

The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate bonds.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 422533, "end_char_idx": 425107, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2854305-0843-43f5-8ba7-83e8512006f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2854305-0843-43f5-8ba7-83e8512006f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e8b17de4b638b7cabd82c4694cc6c15f139c6b7c64b9fffc4e2cd3928f3dc77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a6b6841-0528-4e72-af89-3e9fc2e1fbae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "a2b1a26ecd21fd8dc3bad007f3cc8024d6797279927c44519fde043bd5e304fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "062188cc-92fd-4619-92fb-3f5fdbbdf171", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7b3c18317f977b8ba15c17a7210286da7dfd9d4697b85d6eaeaa1220284a820", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate bonds.

We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Our marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment.

Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary.

We derive our revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from customers' use of Freight services.\n\nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.\n\n87\n\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\n\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction.

We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received.

As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from COVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was less than their carrying value.\n\nTo determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM, weighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees\u2019 capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences. We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed market valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities occurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are considered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the latest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us. A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets.

Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $13.4 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year, offset partially by the release of the valuation allowance due to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the acquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.\n\nThe indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for realization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 681668, "end_char_idx": 684388, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46cf483b-63b3-4fcc-a686-fbfb2eacd773": {"__data__": {"id_": "46cf483b-63b3-4fcc-a686-fbfb2eacd773", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.htm", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "e8b17de4b638b7cabd82c4694cc6c15f139c6b7c64b9fffc4e2cd3928f3dc77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a933903-edfb-42f0-b465-f9c979454fe5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "3e4c38338f0a2e8787b5ec839eb4326070960a0a74b5b940697108ea577fd395", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c7363dc-12ab-491a-bff8-a63714ebe22a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "13e8410ba73eab90483d570eafb571e125e5670f36223971ac14e3aab30358e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.

Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. You can find the full text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nIn accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred.
